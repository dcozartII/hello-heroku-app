# hello-heroku-app
## This is my heroku app that follows the last app but shows it as an actual website
## on heroku.

## About:
Hello-Heroku-app builds off of my hello node app: https://github.com/dcozartII/hello-node-app.
It is all the same code but the main thing we are doing differently is uploading it 
to heroku by creating an account and using the repo from github to add code to the heroku website version.


### Steps to find the website
1. Go to github and find the profile dcozartII
2. Look for the hello-heroku-app repo
3. In the about section is the heroku link
4. Click to view the app

### Steps to add to the code
1. Follow step 1 above
2. Fork it over on your machine as a zip
3. Unizip the file
4. Open the file in VSCode
5. Have fun
